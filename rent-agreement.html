                <h4>Pros of Having a Rent Agreement</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legal Protection:</strong> A rent agreement legally binds the tenant to terms, protecting the owner from potential disputes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Terms of Rent:</strong> It sets clear guidelines on rent amount, payment date, and penalties for late payments, creating a transparent rental relationship.</li>
                    <li><strong>Property Condition Assurance:</strong> The agreement can include clauses that require the tenant to maintain the property, safeguarding the propertyâ€™s condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eviction Security:</strong> If necessary, a documented agreement provides grounds for legal eviction, making it easier to resolve issues legally.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Cons for Owner -->

                <h4>Cons of Not Having a Rent Agreement</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legal Vulnerability:</strong> Without a written agreement, it becomes challenging to enforce rent terms or hold tenants accountable for property damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficulty in Eviction:</strong> In case of non-cooperation, evicting a tenant without a legal agreement can be lengthy and complicated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Rent Revenue:</strong> Without a rent agreement, rent adjustments and penalties for non-payment are harder to enforce, leading to potential income loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Property Risks:</strong> Unspecified responsibilities may lead to the tenant neglecting the upkeep of the property, risking its overall condition.</li>

                    <li><strong>Tenancy Security:</strong> A rent agreement offers security of tenure, ensuring that the tenant has a formal acknowledgment of their right to occupy the property.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protection from Unfair Rent Hikes:</strong> The agreement can include terms that limit sudden rent increases, protecting the tenant from unexpected financial strain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency in Responsibilities:</strong> It defines the maintenance responsibilities, ensuring the tenant knows what is expected in terms of upkeep.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Terms for Security Deposit:</strong> The agreement includes terms for the deposit amount and refund conditions, offering transparency for both parties.</li>
